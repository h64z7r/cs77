Business Analytics and Data Visualisation (ECOM5005)
Video Presentation – Singapore Trimester 2, 2024
Return on assets (ROA) is a financial metric commonly used to assess a company's profitability relative to its asset base or how efficiently the company leverages its assets to generate profit. It is determined by dividing the company's net income by its total assets. The ROA value provides management, analysts, and investors with insights into the effectiveness of the company's resource utilization.
As a market analyst, you aim to explore the factors that could influence a company's ROA. To conduct this analysis, you have gathered data from the Capital IQ database for U.S. companies listed in the SP 500 Index. The data, covering the financial year ending June 2024, is provided in the accompanying Excel file“VP_data_2024_Tri2A.xlxs”.
• ROA: Return on Assets (ROA) reflects a company’s profitability relative to its total assets. It is computed by dividing net income by total assets.
• Total Revenue: The total revenue a company generates from selling its products and services.
• Total Operating Expenses: The overall costs a business incurs during its regular operations, such as marketing, rent, payroll, insurance, inventory expenses, and funds allocated to research and development (RD).
• Cash and Equivalents: refers to items on the balance sheet that represent the value of a company's assets that are either in cash form. or can be quickly converted to cash. Examples include bank accounts and marketable securities, such as commercial paper and short-term government bonds with maturities of less than 90 days.
• Total Liabilities/ Total Assets %: this ratio, also known as the debt ratio, measures the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed through debt.
You are required to perform. a regression analysis to predict which factors (i.e., total revenue, total operating expenses, total cash and equivalents, and the ratio of total liabilities over total assets) can predict return on assets (i.e. ROA) by answering the following questions:
1. Which of the variabl代 写Business Analytics and Data Visualisation (ECOM5005)C/C++

2. Is the regression model useful?
3. Are the errors, i.e. the residuals of the regression analysis, independent?
Note: You should consider to transform. the variables if they are not in the same scales (i.e. one variable is too big compared to others).
